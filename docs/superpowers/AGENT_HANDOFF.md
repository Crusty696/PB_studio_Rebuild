# PB Studio Agent Handoff

This file is a repository-local continuity checkpoint for all agents.

## Current Protocol

1. Start every agent session with:

   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\agent_start.ps1
   ```

2. End or switch every agent session with:

   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\agent_handoff.ps1
   ```

3. Source of truth order:

   - Git commits on the current branch.
   - `docs/superpowers/ACTIVE_PLAN.md`.
   - Vault living plan and `C:\Brain-Bug\projects\pb-studio\log.md`.
   - This file.

4. Chat history is not source of truth. If it is not in Git or Vault, next
   agent must treat it as unknown.

## Current Branch

`main`

## Current Active Plan

See `docs/superpowers/ACTIVE_PLAN.md`.

## Required Handoff State

Handoff must be one of:

- clean commit;
- named stash with exact reason and path list;
- explicit user-approved dirty state documented in Vault and chat.

Unknown dirty changes block work.
